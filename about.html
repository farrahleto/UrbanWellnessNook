    <i><h2>Our Story</h2></i>
    
    <p>
        My name is Farrah Leto and I am a senior in college studying Biomedical Engineering with concentrations in pre-medicine and biomaterials & biopharmeseutical technologies.

        I first noticed the healthcare disparity while in high school. I attended high school in East Harlem, New York which has one of the highest rates of poverty, rent-burdened households, and housing court actions in New York City. I quickly became aware of the healthcare disparity in this area not necessarily due to the lack of facilities, but more so due to the lack of education and resources made available to the residents. It is common that individuals living below the poverty line must spend more time working to cover basic necessities, such as rent, groceries, etc., that they may not have enough time to deep dive the internet/local flyers to find quality affordable healthcare.

        To begin combating this problem I became heavily involved with the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center, a free clinic for young adults. From being an ambassador in this program I learned about the wide disparity in healthcare primarily in urban settings whether that be physical care or medical education. We focused on educating the youth of East Harlem on free services available to them and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

        Urban Wellness Nook stems from a place of love and understanding of the necessity of accessible healthcare. With my project I hope to establish a centralized platform where individuals can effortlessly access free and accessible healthcare resources. By streamlining this process, I hope to afford people more time in their day for pursuits beyond healthcare, fostering a more empowered and resilient community.
